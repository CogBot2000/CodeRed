This file is not code.  It is a requirements file for adding hypergames to CodeRed.
The most important first step is being able to work with CogBot2000 on this project.
Then I want to work with marine1vane.
Or lambeda2 to develop some R code to evaluate hypergames.

Then we'll make a gui to build hypergames.
Then we'll come up with a way to add evidence.

Now CogBot2000 believes that we need a value function.
Some way to choose better options.

Marine1vane is trying to commit this change to master

You did it!  Congrats!

CogBot3 on hypergame-needs branch (cannot edit master, must work on branch)
So this should be able to be merged by CogBot2000
And it should still have Duke's changes.
